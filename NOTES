3 important headers
elf header
section header (linking)
segment header (runtime)

	architecture (can also be ignored, see above)
	--
	an index into section header which points to ".shstrtab"
	an offset to segment header (phoff)
	an offset to section header (shoff)

section header contains:
	dynamic linking information (Shdr->sh_type == SHT_DYNAMIC) (6)*
	dynamic linker symbol table (Shdr->sh_type == SHT_DYNSYM)  (11)*
	symbol table                (Shdr->sh_type == SHT_SYMTAB)  (2)*
	symbol string table         (Shdr->sh_type == SHT_STRTAB)  (3)*

segment header contains:
	dynamic linking information (Phdr->p_type == PT_DYNAMIC)  (2)*

* Values which are defined by Linux 5.3.0
